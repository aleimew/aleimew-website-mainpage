Hi, my name is Alex Moore, and I'm someone who never learned what the term
"master of none" meant. I graduated back in 2020 with a degree in Computer
Science and a minor in Digital Studies, and I only decided now that making
this website miiiiight be a good idea. 

I'm currently attempting to get my foot in the door with software development,
hence why I made this website myself with React. Though, I'm also pursing more
creative fields, more specifically video/film making, writing, and game development,
to name a few.

This website is still a work in progress, but eventually, I'll have seperate
tabs for what I've done regaurding each field I'm interested in.
